Grade 8 South Carolina and the United States Students will study the history of South Carolina, within context of United States history in grade eight. This study begins with South Carolina’s colonial development and settlement as a British colony. South Carolinians played pivotal roles throughout the American Revolution and the Constitutional Convention, which established the foundations for the new nation. Sectional division came as a result of the growing institution of slavery, interpretations of the role of government, and expansion of the nation. South Carolina led the secession of Southern states, culminating in the Civil War. As the nation attempted to heal the wounds of the war, Reconstruction policies brought about political change while sectional division remained. The end of the 19th century ushered in industrialization to South Carolina and the nation, providing new opportunities for many people. Throughout the 20th century, South Carolina emerged as a national leader for defense production, agriculture, and tourism. As the state grew economically, social change was also brought on by the Civil Rights Movement. During the turn of the 21st century, South Carolina continues to attract businesses and people, while continuing to find solutions to new challenges. Instruction should utilize the historical thinking skills and themes developed for grade eight. The progression of developmentally appropriate historical thinking skills begins in kindergarten and builds with each year of history instruction. These historical thinking skills are aligned with the Profile of the South Carolina Graduate, with a focus on world-class knowledge, world-class skills, and life and career characteristics. The indicators of standard one represent the skills utilized by students in each grade level to further explore the content. These skills have been deconstructed to aid in the scaffolding of student thinking and are not to be taught in isolation. The Social Studies grade-level standards are categorized into content- and discipline-specific themes. These themes allow for connections to be made between content when teaching chronologically, the ability to teach thematically rather than chronologically, and to support project- or problem-based learning. These themes also allow students the opportunity to create change by engaging in civic participation. "
